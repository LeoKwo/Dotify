# INFO 448 Homework 1 Layouts, Widgets, Event Handling

**Description**
This app is a mockup music player. It randomlly generates a number of songs played in the beginning which adds one every time the user clicks on the play button. It also responds to the user's button presses and text entry.

**Extra credit attempted**
- A user is not allowed to apply a new username if the edit text field is empty.
- Long pressing on the cover image changes the text color of the play count to a different color.
- All hardcoded dimensions & colors are extracted into res/values/dimens.xml & res/values/colors.xml respectively
  - I have also put most strings into res/values/strings.xml
- If using ConstraintLayout, utilize a Barrier or Guideline somewhere with a view constrained to it
