# INFO 448 Homework 4 - Application, JSON parsing & Network Requests
## Leo Kwo
**Description**
This app is a mockup music player. It randomlly generates a number of songs played in the beginning which adds one every time the user clicks on the play button. It also responds to the user's button presses and text entry.

In homework 2, I implemented a list of all the songs in the playlist that can respond to user's touch input and can shuffle itself when user clicks the shuffle button.

In homework 3, I implemented landscape views for the player and the list of songs screens. I also added a settings page where the users can access information about the current user, the song statistics, and app information.

In homework 4, I added the ability to store and retrieve data from the Application object. The app is now also capabale of fetching and parsing json from the internet. The songlistactivity also now supports swipe to refresh.


**Extra credit attempted**
- SongListActivity with swipe to refresh.
