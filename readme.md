# INFO 448 Homework 4 - Application, JSON parsing & Network Requests
## Leo Kwo
**Description**
This app is a mockup music player. It randomlly generates a number of songs played in the beginning which adds one every time the user clicks on the play button. It also responds to the user's button presses and text entry.

In homework 2, I implemented a list of all the songs in the playlist that can respond to user's touch input and can shuffle itself when user clicks the shuffle button.

In homework 3, I implemented landscape views for the player and the list of songs screens. I also added a settings page where the users can access information about the current user, the song statistics, and app information.

In homework 4, balsdhaksfasf

need to modify everything down here.
